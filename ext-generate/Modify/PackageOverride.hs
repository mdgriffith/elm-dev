{-
Hot override mapping for specific packages. When hot mode is enabled, we
replace registry downloads for certain packages with forks that support
hot-reload semantics.

Enable by setting environment variable ELM_DEV_HOT to "1".

Branch zip vs release zip (why normalization is needed):
  - Registry downloads use release artifacts that are structured in a way our
    extractor expects (top-level prefix handling is consistent).
  - GitHub "zipball" of a branch adds a top-level directory like
    "repo-branch/" before all paths. Without trimming that common prefix, the
    package contents end up nested (e.g. repo-branch/src/..), so the build
    cannot find modules under the expected "src/" root. We normalize override
    archives by removing the common top-level directory if present.
