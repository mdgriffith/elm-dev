{- GHCI thread management

Developing threaded processes in GHCI can be rather tricky, as threads are directly
invoked from the main GHCI thread, so they don't die unless you kill GHCI and reload,
a rather slow process.

In order to get closer to the holy grail of "":r + kill + reload threads", useful
when working on and testing a daemon, the `trackedForkIO` function is a drop-in
replacement for `forkIO`, which paired with `killTrackedThreads` lets us cleanup
after a `:r` and avoid issues like a socket port already being in use!
